# 🎬 LIVE DEMO NARRATION SCRIPT
## What to Say During Each Feature Demo

---

## 🎯 INTRO (While script starts - 15 seconds)

**What to say:**

> "Hi everyone, I'm [Your Name], and this is Provenance Pro - the infrastructure layer for verifiable AI.
> 
> Today I'm going to show you a live demo on Sui testnet. Everything you're about to see is real - real blockchain transactions, real payments, real decentralized storage on Walrus.
> 
> Let's dive in."

---

## 📦 STEP 1: CREATE FREE REPOSITORY (30 seconds)

**What to say:**

> "First, let's create a free AI model repository. 
> 
> In Provenance Pro, every model is a repository - just like GitHub, but for AI. Each repository is an NFT on Sui blockchain, giving you true ownership.
> 
> Watch as we create this repository... [wait for transaction]
> 
> There it is! You can see the repository ID. Let me open this on Suiscan so you can see it on the blockchain.
> 
> [Open the Suiscan link]
> 
> Here's our repository - it's a real object on Sui. You can see the owner, the name, and it's set to free access. This is all immutable and verifiable."

---

## 🌊 STEP 2: COMMIT MODEL TO WALRUS (45 seconds)

**What to say:**

> "Now let's upload an AI model. But we're not uploading to AWS or Google Cloud - we're using Walrus, a decentralized storage network.
> 
> Watch what happens: Provenance Pro takes our model file, shards it into cryptographic pieces, and distributes those shards across Walrus nodes. The manifest - the map of where all the pieces are - gets stored on Sui.
> 
> This means the model is censorship-resistant. No single company can delete it. It's permanent.
> 
> [Wait for upload to complete]
> 
> Perfect! You can see the transaction hash. Let me show you this on Suiscan.
> 
> [Open transaction link]
> 
> This transaction just recorded the Walrus blob IDs on Sui blockchain. The actual model data is distributed across Walrus nodes, but the proof is here on Sui.
> 
> If we refresh the repository page, you'll see it now has version 1 with all the metadata."

---

## 💰 STEP 3: CREATE PAID REPOSITORY (30 seconds)

**What to say:**

> "Now here's where it gets interesting for monetization. Let's create a premium model that costs 0.01 SUI to access.
> 
> This is how AI creators can actually earn from their work. The smart contract handles everything - payments, access control, revenue tracking.
> 
> [Wait for creation]
> 
> There we go! Let me show you this paid repository on Suiscan.
> 
> [Open paid repo link]
> 
> See that price field? 0.01 SUI. And there's a revenue field that tracks total earnings. This is a business model built into the blockchain."

---

## 🌳 STEP 4: FORK REPOSITORY (NFT + LINEAGE) (45 seconds)

**What to say:**

> "One of the biggest problems in AI is model theft. Someone takes your model, fine-tunes it, and claims it as their own.
> 
> Provenance Pro solves this with on-chain lineage tracking. Watch as we fork this repository.
> 
> [Wait for fork]
> 
> Now we have a child repository. Let me show you the lineage tree.
> 
> [Wait for inspect command]
> 
> See this? The dependency tree shows the parent-child relationship. And here's the key: if this forked model generates revenue, 5% automatically goes to the parent creator. The smart contract enforces this.
> 
> [Open forked repo on Suiscan]
> 
> On Suiscan, you can see the parent field pointing to the original repository. This is immutable proof of lineage. You can't fake this. You can't delete this. It's on the blockchain forever."

---

## 💳 STEP 5: PURCHASE ACCESS (REAL PAYMENT) (40 seconds)

**What to say:**

> "Now let's buy access to that premium model. This is a real payment - 0.01 SUI from my wallet to the creator's wallet.
> 
> Watch the transaction happen...
> 
> [Wait for payment]
> 
> Done! Let me show you the payment transaction on Suiscan.
> 
> [Open payment transaction]
> 
> This is the actual payment. You can see the SUI moving from my address to the repository owner. This happened in seconds, with minimal fees.
> 
> Now if we go back to the repository...
> 
> [Open paid repo again]
> 
> Refresh this page... see the revenue field? It just increased by 0.01 SUI. This is real-time revenue tracking on the blockchain."

---

## 📥 STEP 6: PULL MODEL FROM WALRUS (30 seconds)

**What to say:**

> "After purchasing access, we can download the model. Remember, it's stored on Walrus in shards.
> 
> Watch as Provenance Pro retrieves all the shards from different Walrus nodes and reconstructs the file.
> 
> [Wait for download]
> 
> Perfect! The file is downloaded and verified. The cryptographic hashes ensure we got exactly what was uploaded - no tampering, no corruption.
> 
> This is the power of decentralized storage. The model is always available, always verifiable."

---

## 📊 STEP 7: GENERATE AUDIT REPORT (40 seconds)

**What to say:**

> "Finally, let's talk about compliance. The EU AI Act requires documentation of training data, model provenance, performance metrics.
> 
> Provenance Pro generates this automatically from blockchain data.
> 
> [Wait for report generation]
> 
> The report is opening in your browser now...
> 
> [Show the HTML report]
> 
> Look at this: we have version history, training metrics, interactive charts showing loss and accuracy over time. We have the Walrus blob IDs, the Sui transaction hashes - everything is linked to verifiable blockchain data.
> 
> This is a legal-grade compliance document generated in seconds. No manual paperwork. Just click, generate, submit to regulators."

---

## 🎯 CLOSING (30 seconds)

**What to say:**

> "So let me recap what we just did in 5 minutes:
> 
> We created repositories on Sui blockchain. We uploaded models to Walrus decentralized storage. We demonstrated monetization with real payments. We showed lineage tracking to prevent theft. And we generated EU AI Act compliance reports.
> 
> All of this is live on testnet right now. Every transaction I showed you is real and verifiable on Suiscan.
> 
> This is Provenance Pro - we're building the GitHub for the AI era. Verifiable, monetizable, compliant AI infrastructure.
> 
> Thank you!"

## 💡 TIPS FOR DELIVERY

### Pacing
- Speak clearly and not too fast
- Let the blockchain transactions complete before moving on
- Use the pauses while commands run to explain what's happening

### Emphasis Points
- **"Real blockchain transactions"** - emphasize this is not a mock demo
- **"Censorship-resistant"** - key benefit of Walrus
- **"Automatic royalties"** - solves the monetization problem
- **"Immutable proof"** - can't be faked or deleted
- **"Legal-grade compliance"** - EU AI Act ready

### Interaction with Screen
- Point to specific fields on Suiscan (owner, price, revenue, parent)
- Highlight the transaction hashes
- Show the charts in the audit report
- Demonstrate the lineage tree visualization

### If Something Goes Wrong
- **Transaction slow?** → "Blockchain transactions take a few seconds, this is normal"
- **Command fails?** → "Let me try that again" (have backup plan)
- **Link doesn't load?** → Have screenshots ready as backup

### Energy Level
- Start high energy for intro
- Maintain enthusiasm throughout
- Build excitement for the payment transaction
- End strong with the compliance report

## 🎬 READY TO RECORD!

Run the demo with:
```powershell
.\LIVE-DEMO.ps1
```

The script will pause at each step, giving you time to narrate and show the Suiscan links.

**Good luck! You've got this! 🚀**
