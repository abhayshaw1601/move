Demo AI Model for CLI Testing
==============================

Model Type: Neural Network
Architecture: Transformer
Parameters: 1.5B
Training Data: Custom Dataset

This is a demo model file for testing the CLI commit functionality.
The model demonstrates the complete workflow of uploading AI models
to the blockchain with full provenance tracking.

Training Metrics:
- Accuracy: 97.5%
- Loss: 0.08
- F1-Score: 0.96
- Precision: 0.97
- Recall: 0.95

Model Features:
- Multi-head attention
- Layer normalization
- Dropout regularization
- Adam optimizer
- Learning rate scheduling

This model file will be sharded and uploaded to Walrus storage,
with metadata stored on the Sui blockchain for complete provenance.
