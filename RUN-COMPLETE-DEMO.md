## 📊 WHAT IT DOES

### Real Blockchain Transactions:
1. **Creates FREE repository** - NFT on Sui
2. **Commits model** - Shards file, uploads to Walrus, stores manifest on Sui
3. **Creates PAID repository** - Sets price to 0.01 SUI
4. **Forks repository** - Creates parent-child relationship with 5% royalties
5. **Purchases access** - Makes REAL 0.01 SUI payment
6. **Downloads model** - Reconstructs from Walrus shards
7. **Generates report** - EU AI Act compliance document

### Prints Suiscan Links:
- Free repository object
- Paid repository object
- Forked repository object
- Transaction hashes
- Smart contract package
